- Permit to omit useless functions in events ( like update or collisionAction for event3c, or movements for chest0 )

- Create base Events lua pseudo-classes in C++, and get them by xml, like:
		<events>
			<event type="Character" x="15" y="12" name="Boy"/>
			<event type="Custom" name="event0"/>
		</events>
	* In maps.xml events should be represented like that:
		<maps>
			<map ...>
				<event name="Boy"/>
				<event name="event0"/>
			</map>
		</maps>
	* Obviously, there is always Lua events for Custom event type
	* solid="1" by default
	* for chests, anim is replaced by "type" and for characters by "direction"

- Add a class "LuaMod" or "ModScript" or "Mod"

- Add an XML overlay, in order to follow the DRY concept

- Add a Switch class
- Add other Lua pseudo-classes like "Enemy", "Door", "Teleporter", "Switch", etc...

- Add a lot of functions to Window class
	* Like "printActorHP(actor, x, y, width, height)" which will display something like "HP:	320"
	=> It might be helpful in the near future

- Fix issues:
	* #14 - Improve some code parts
	* #16 - Work on transitions between maps
	* #17 - Up and Down keys have an higher priority than Left and Right ones
	* #19 - Improve Activity rendering by screenshotting and saving previous screen, to display it faster
	* #29 - Improve victory window

- Improve battler death color fading

- Manage disabled items in SelectableWindow ( maybe use a std::vector<std::pair<std::string, bool>>> for commands container )

- Let ItemWindows get data they'll display
- EquipItemWindow should be removed
	* Solve that problem: ItemWindow::getItem()
- Manage usable Items and their function through a lua script by object
- Create a new class ItemChoiceWindow which represents all the possibilities to do with the Item we choosed
	( For example a potion have a choice "Use" which change the mode to ChooseActorTarget )

- Create a new class SkillActivity, child of ItemActivity
	* Add it in the menu
	* Add it in the battles

- Maybe create Activity child classes instead of modes for BattleActivity

- ISSUE #30 Add new stats for battlers and weapons
	=> Damage formula improvement needed
	=> Sort BattleAction by battlers' speed
	=> Add stats growth functions

- Rename "Animation" struct to "SpriteAnimation"
- Create a class "Animation", child class of Sprite, in order to handle things like animations in battles

- Make shop interface, callable from an event ( like a ShopActivity )
	* ShopChoiceWindow

- Make a DebugWindow which will help to test a lot of things

- Lua scripts for dungeons:
	* File tree like that:
		dungeons/
		---- dungeon1/
		---- ---- room1/
		---- ---- ---- main.lua
		---- dungeon 2/
	* etc..

- Improve EquipWindow performances on Android

- Add colors in text

- Check bugs

- Test porting to Android, Windows and Mac OS X

- Engine finished!
