- Let ItemWindows get data they'll display
- Delete EquipItemWindow and remplace it by a simple ItemWindow
- Manage usable Items and their function through a lua script by object
- Create a new class ItemChoiceWindow which represents all the possibilities to do with the Item we choosed
	( For example a potion have a choice "Use" which change the mode to ChooseActorTarget )
- Create a new class SkillWindow
	* Add it in the menu
	* Add it in the battles
- Maybe create Activity child classes instead of modes for BattleActivity
- Add new stats for battlers and weapons
	=> Damage formula improvement needed
	=> Sort BattleAction by battlers' speed
- Animations in battles
