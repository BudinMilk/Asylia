- Improve CharacterEvent inclusion with a require or a dofile in the C++ loading of events
- Permit to omit useless functions in events ( like update or collisionAction for event3c, or movements for chest0 )

- Add other Lua pseudo-classes like "Enemy", "Door", "Teleporter", etc...

- Fix issues:
	* #32 - Sometimes, when the actors win the battle, there's another turn, then a segfault
	* #29 - Improve victory window
	* #19 - Improve Activity rendering by screenshotting and saving previous screen, to display it faster
	* #17 - Up and Down keys have an higher priority than Left and Right ones
	* #16 - Work on transitions between maps
	* #14 - Improve some code parts

- Let ItemWindows get data they'll display
- Adapt ItemWindow to in-battle display
- EquipItemWindow should be a child ItemWindow
	* Solve that problem: ItemWindow::getItem()
- Manage usable Items and their function through a lua script by object
- Create a new class ItemChoiceWindow which represents all the possibilities to do with the Item we choosed
	( For example a potion have a choice "Use" which change the mode to ChooseActorTarget )

- Create a new class SkillWindow, child of ItemWindow
	* Add it in the menu
	* Add it in the battles

- Maybe create Activity child classes instead of modes for BattleActivity

- ISSUE #30 Add new stats for battlers and weapons
	=> Damage formula improvement needed
	=> Sort BattleAction by battlers' speed

- Rename "Animation" struct to "SpriteAnimation"
- Create a class "Animation" in order to handle things like animations in battles

- Lua scripts for dungeons:
	* File tree like that:
		dungeons/
		---- dungeon1/
		---- ---- room1/
		---- ---- ---- main.lua
		---- dungeon 2/
	* etc..

- Check bugs

- Test porting to Android, Windows and Mac OS X

- Engine finished!
